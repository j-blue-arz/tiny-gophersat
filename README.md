# Gophersat, a SAT and pseudo-boolean solver written in Go

This is a fork of [crillab/gophersat](https://github.com/crillab/gophersat) with the goal to make it work with TinyGo. Currently, this is not possible with the upstream version at least due to [one issue](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues/1037) of TinyGo.

Go to [https://github.com/crillab/gophersat](https://github.com/crillab/gophersat) for more information.
